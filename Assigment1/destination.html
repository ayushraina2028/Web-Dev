        <h4>Accomodations:</h4>
        <p>
            Currently there are no Accomodations available there, because the trek is located in a forest area. There are some Accomodations available in Magadi district which is 10 km away from Savandurga. Usually this is a one day trip for Banglore people so they do not book Accomodations.
